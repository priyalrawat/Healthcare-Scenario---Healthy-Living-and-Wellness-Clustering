# Healthcare-Scenario---Healthy-Living-and-Wellness-Clustering

**Abstract**

This study focuses on the application of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify wellness profiles from a simulated medical dataset. The dataset consisted of 200 patients details including their five key lifestyle variables such as exercise time, healthy meals per day, hours of sleep, stress level and body mass index. Unsupervised machine learning techniques like K-Means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and DBSCAN were performed for clustering and identifying patterns. Dimensionality reduction was done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which provided more insight into the data. Evaluation metrics which were used as Silhouette Score, Within-cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), Davies Bouldin Index and Calinski Harabasz Score to determine a number of well-formed clusters. K-Means was identified as the best technique, achieving the highest silhouette score of 0.398 after PCA transformation, and showing well-formed, distinct clusters. The findings of this study provide support for the use of clustering models to enable the segmentation of patient populations in support of wellness intervention strategies.  The study illustrates how unsupervised learning may be leveraged to accelerate data-driven approaches to preventive healthcare.
